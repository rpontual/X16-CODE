# X16-CODE
Repository for code that runs on the CommanderX16 product

LIFE
It is a game based on Conway's Game of Life. The game is written entirely in BASIC for exploring techniques to accelerate code written in the former Commodore C64 Version 2 baisc. It has been tested on the Commander X16 emulator release 32.

The code appears to run properly but we plan to improve certain components of the code to:
1) Improve the user entry interface
2) Improve the screen graphics while the game is running
3) Seek opportunities to increase processing speed between generations
4) Let user choose background and foreground colors
5) Create a dramatic end if the populations is extinguished

If you like the project and would like to improve it, please feel free to do it. The only restriction is to right your code in BASIC, we all know that assembly would increase performance but it would defeat the point.
